'''
Objec­tive:  Given ‘n’ Nuts and ‘n’ Bolts of different sizes. There is one-to-one mapping between nuts and bolts.
Write an algorithm to find all matches between nuts and bolts

Note: This problem can also be framed as- Given ‘n’ keys and ‘n’ locks.
There is one-to-one mapping between keys and locks, means each lock has a specific key and can be unlocked using
that key only. Write an algorithm to find all matches between keys and locks.

You are allowed to compare only nuts with bolts (or keys with locks), nuts with nuts or bolts with bolts comparisons are not allowed.
